                 <h1>Activism</h1>
                 <h3><p>Watson is an outspoken feminist. She has promoted
                 education for girls, travelling to Bangladesh and Zambia
                 to do so. In July 2014, she was appointed a UN Women Goodwill
                 ambassador. That September, an admittedly nervous Watson 
                 delivered an address at UN Headquarters in New York City
                 to launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which aims to
                 urge men to advocate for gender equality. In that speech
                 she said she began questioning gender-based assumptions
                 at age eight when she was called "bossy" (a trait she has
                 attributed to her being a "perfectionist") whilst boys were
                 not, and at 14 when she was "sexualised by certain elements
                 of the media". Further, Watson's speech described feminism as 
                 "the belief that men and women should have equal rights and 
                 opportunities" and declared that the perception of "man-hating"
                 is something that "has to stop".</p><p>In March 2017, Watson received
                 backlash for a Vanity Fair photo shoot in which one of the shots 
                 had her breasts partly visible; some in the news media accused her
                 of hypocrisy. Bemused by the controversy, she argued that 
                 "feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women" but is
                 instead about freedom, liberation and equality, adding, "I really
                 don't know what my tits have to do with it."Watson has
                discussed her white privilege in feminist spaces;</p></h3>
