            <p>Cascading Style Sheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML.
                 While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style 
                 it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of
                  your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
            <h2 id="prequisites">Prequisites</h2>
            <p>
                You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.</p>
            <p> Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth 
                between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't learn 
                CSS without knowing HTML.</p>
            <p> Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it, 
                consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up, as detailed in Installing basic software, and understand 
                how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of which are parts of our Getting started with the web 
                complete beginner's module.</p>
             <p> It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding with this topic, especially if 
                you are completely new to web development. However, much of what is covered in its CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS
                 first steps module, albeit in a lot more detail.
            </p>     
            <h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
            <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should start with the first one.</p>

            <p class="name">CSS first steps</p>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing 
                of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle
                 beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start 
                 using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

             <p class="name"> CSS building blocks</p>
             <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got 
                some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the
                 selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>

            <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory,
                     before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>

             <p class="name">CSS styling text</p>
             <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most 
                common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and 
                letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, 
                and styling lists and links.</p>

             <p class="name">CSS layout</p>
            <p>At this point, we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your
                content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place with respect to the viewport, and one
                 another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display 
                 settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still 
                 want to know about.</p>
             <h2 id="solving">Solving common CSS problems</h2>
             <p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve very common
              problems when creating a web page.</p>
              <p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and
                 position of elements; and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't do once you have a solid
                  understanding of even the basics of CSS. One of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the fundamentals,
                   usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done, even if you don't know how to do it yet!</p>
             <h2 id="working">Working with CSS</h2>
             <p>The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties that I have used are as 
                follows - each one links to its property page on MDN, which will give you more examples of its use.</p>
                <ul >
                    <li class="properties">font-family</li>
                    <li class="properties">color</li>
                    <li class="properties">border-bottom</li>
                    <li class="properties">font-weight</li>
                    <li class="properties">font-size</li>
                    <li class="properties">text-decoration</li>
                </ul>
             <h2 id="adding">Adding CSS</h2>  
             <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules
                we want it to use.There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll
                 commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS 
                 from the head of your document.</p>
                 <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this
                     is a CSS file.</p>
                 <p> To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the head of the HTML document:
              </p>
             <p class="link">link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"</p>
             <h2 id="see">See also</h2>
             <p class="last"> The main entry point for CSS documentation on MDN, where you'll find detailed reference documentation for all features of the
              CSS language. Want to know all the values a property can take? This is a good place to go.</p>
